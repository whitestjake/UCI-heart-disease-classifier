# UCI Heart Disease Classification Model

This is a project used to demonstrate the capability of machine learning models to aid in medical diagnosis
For this project I utilized the Kaggle dataset which can be found here
```https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/redwankarimsony/heart-disease-data/data```
originally I uploaded the dataset to a SQL database for additional functionality,
however I decided to rework it to rely on just the csv for easy repeatability.

How to get the project working

-- pulling from this repository --
1. Open your terminal, navigate to desired working directory, some examples below
   
   ```cd \filename```
   
   ```mkdir desired-file-name```
   
   ```cd \desired-file-name```
   
2. Once in desired directory, clone this repository
   
   ```https://github.com/whitestjake/UCI-heart-disease-classifier.git```
   
3. Next, you need to install dependencies, in most cases jupyter notebook will come with these depencies preinstalled
   
   ```pip install notebook pandas numpy matplotlib```
   
4. Launch Jupter Notebook within your terminal
   
   ```jupyter notebook```
   
5. Remember to adjust your file name to match whatever you decided to download it as and with the correct path, I installed in the same file directory as my code, I reccommend doing the same.
    
6.  Run the code and it should work no problem!!
